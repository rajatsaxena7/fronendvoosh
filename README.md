- **Mixins** - For reusable style patterns
- **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with media queries
- **Component-scoped Styles** - Each component has its own SCSS file

## Customization

The project uses a modern color palette. You can customize colors by modifying the SCSS variables in each component file.

### Layout
The layout is built with CSS Grid and Flexbox for modern, responsive design.

### Components
Each component is self-contained with its own JavaScript and SCSS files for easy maintenance and reusability.
